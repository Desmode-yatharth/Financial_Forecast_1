Project Description: SPY Stock Price Forecasting Pipeline with Binary LSTM and Attention

Overview:
This project implements a complete machine learning pipeline to forecast directional price movements (up or down) of the SPY (S&P 500 ETF) using historical financial data. The pipeline fetches data, engineers technical indicators, preprocesses it into sequences, optionally reduces dimensionality with PCA, and trains an advanced LSTM model with attention for binary classification. The goal is to achieve a directional accuracy of approximately 65%, improving upon an initial ~50% accuracy, with visualization of results for assessment.

Objective:
The primary objective is to predict whether the SPY price will increase (1) or decrease (0) on the next trading day based on historical price and volume data. The system integrates feature engineering, sequence modeling, dimensionality reduction, and deep learning to capture market patterns, focusing on actionable directional predictions for trading strategies.

Inference: I didn't reach an  directional accuracy of 65%.
